{"name":"HomeRemote","tagline":"","body":"# Welcome to HomeRemote (Alpha)\r\nHomeRemote is an open source project based upon using the hardware of the Raspberry Pi to its maximum potential. The Raspberry Pi has been used many times as a home automation controller but many of these projects have been lacking many professional aspects that a good home system should have. A company by the name of HAI (Home Automation Inc.) develops many amazing systems that cover every corner of the home automation industry and do so in an amazing, convenient way. My aim with HomeRemote is to follow that goal of unified home automation.\r\n\r\nThis page is dedicated to the HomeRemote project and will provide instructions on setup and usage of the HomeRemote system.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nSome features of the HomeRemote software are below, and remember, there will always be more to come!\r\n\r\n**Web-based Control Interface**\r\nA crafty, sleek, and easy to use interface that (for now) is your means of setting up and controlling all aspects of your home system.\r\n\r\n**Lights**\r\nControl lights all around your house. With a relay board hooked up to your Raspberry Pi, you can setup lights which can be toggled on or off at a certain time, by switches, or other simple conditions\r\n\r\n**Advanced Event System**\r\nCustom events that complete actions when a certain condition is met. Turn off a light at 5:00 AM, toggle a light on for a certain amount of time when a motion sensor is tripped, or disable another event when its bedtime. It makes you not have to worry about forgetting to turn on your porch light before you leave.\r\n\r\n**Security System**\r\nWith two modes of operation, arm your alarm system for when you leave the house, or when you go to bed at night. With configurable settings such as alarm delays, arming delays, and calling your cell phone, you can remove the worry of a burglar breaking into your home.\r\n\r\n**Climate Control**\r\nAnnoyed with always adjusting your thermostat to the comfortable temperature? Set up a custom cooling temperature for when it gets to hot, or a heating temperature when it gets to cold. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow all this sounds great right? Unfortunately I am a one man crew so it takes time to roll out these features. But they ARE coming! See the changelogs and to-dos for what I'm working on/have added.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nDocumentation is being worked on right now. I am going to catch up with where I am on the coding end before I start adding new features. But this shouldn't take long.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nDownload of this project is separated into two pieces: the server side software which is what actually runs everything, and the web interface which is used to control everything.\r\n\r\nServer-side:\r\nhttps://github.com/kilker12/HomeRemoteServer\r\n\r\nWeb-interface:\r\nhttps://github.com/kilker12/HomeRemoteWeb","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
